# MinesweeperAI

## About
When I was a kid I always enjoyed playing Minesweeper on the computer, so this is my attempt at creating an AI for it. The project started as just a recreation of the game, but after finishing that I decided to attempt to implement an AI. The AI was written in pure javascript, using the DOM and javascript canvas API. The AI uses a probability map to determine which tiles are likely mines and flags them if so. If it cannot make a guaranteed move, it takes a guess. The AI is very successful at solving most puzzles with less than 90 mines, but as the puzzles become extreme, the AI can become overwhelmed.
